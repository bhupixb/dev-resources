# dev-resources
A collection of useful websites/tools for Developers. I have collected these over the years
from different sources like reddit, hackernews, youtube or online articles etc.
Even I forget these from time to time, so this is for my quick reference as well :)

### Code Search

When working/using with Open source tools/frameworks, sometimes we run into errors/exception message.
But unable to figure out much from message, it may be useful if we look around the code to gather more
info regarding this message. So, in such cases a quick search on these tools can help you.
